# SignalNex

> From scattered client signals to governed advisor action.

**SignalNex** is an AI-powered advisory command centre built for the **AAG x ASG ImagineHack 2026 — Track 1** challenge. It transforms fragmented client data into prioritised daily actions, intelligent partner referrals, and compliance-governed workflows — helping insurance and financial advisors know **who to contact first, what to say next, which partner to involve, and what guardrail to check before action.**

## Challenge and Approach

### The Problem

Advisors manage dozens of daily signals — policy reviews, missed premiums, client life events, business changes, partner opportunities, CPD needs, and compliance requirements. This information is typically scattered across CRM notes, calendars, messages, spreadsheets, and personal memory.

The result:
- Slower client follow-up and missed high-value opportunities
- Inconsistent partner referrals across AAG / ASG business units
- Late compliance and consent checks
- Higher dependence on advisor memory over structured intelligence


### Features Delivered

We successfully delivered the following fully functional features in our prototype to solve this problem:

**Productivity Features:**
- **Daily Advisor Morning Brief**: Summarises top priority clients, overnight signals, overdue tasks, and upcoming meetings.
- **Client Priority Queue**: Automatically ranks the client book based on urgency, premium value, propensity, and open tasks.
- **Client Memory & AI Behavioural Profile**: AI-generated summary of the client's interests, life events, and optimal communication channels.
- **Telegram Bot Integration**: Governed action composer to generate and send compliant client messages directly from the dashboard.

**Growth Features:**
- **Automated Partner Matching**: Connects client needs to AAG/ASG partners (e.g., SME Risk Solutions, Tax Advisory) with match scores.
- **Referral Pipeline Tracker**: Visualises open referrals with expected revenue value and stage progression (Identify → Engage → Closed).

**Learning Features:**
- **Smart Learning Path**: OpenAI-powered recommendation engine that suggests CPD modules based on the advisor's portfolio density.
- **Real-Time Knowledge Gap Detection**: Scans advisor notes to detect compliance or knowledge gaps and automatically assigns rapid micro-learning modules.
- **Knowledge Gate Quizzes**: Scenario-based quizzes contextualised to the advisor's real client book to test applied knowledge.

**Governance Features:**
- **PDPA Consent Masking**: Automatically detects expired consent, masks private client details, and completely blocks follow-ups or referrals until renewed.
- **Compliance Risk Scoring**: Flags accounts with missed premiums or high service risk before recommendations are made.
- **Dual-Role Admin Dashboard**: A separate workspace for Admins to review compliance queues, flag expenses, and monitor a real-time audit trail of all advisor actions.

### Our Approach

SignalNex addresses these gaps through **four integrated layers**:

1. **Productivity Layer** — AI-ranked client priority queue, morning brief, next-best-action engine, and Telegram-powered action composer so advisors know exactly who to contact and what to say.

2. **Growth Layer** — Automated partner desk matching (ASG Tax Advisory, AAG Estate Concierge, SME Risk Solutions, etc.), referral pipeline tracking with stage progression, and revenue impact visibility.

3. **Learning Layer** — Adaptive CPD system with portfolio-density analysis, real-time knowledge gap detection from advisor notes, AI-recommended learning paths, and Knowledge Gate quizzes contextualised to the advisor's actual client book.

4. **Governance Layer** — PDPA consent masking that blocks all private workflows until consent is verified, compliance risk scoring, admin review queues, expense flagging, and a full audit trail visible to both advisor and admin roles.

### Key Differentiators

- **Signal-to-Action Pipeline**: We don't just show data — we rank, recommend, draft, and govern the action.
- **Consent-Locked Clients**: Private signals are masked, follow-ups are blocked, and referrals are prevented until PDPA consent is verified — proving real privacy-by-design thinking.
- **Dual-Role Experience**: Advisors and Admins each get a purpose-built workspace from a single login.
- **Relationship Intelligence**: Client Memory, AI Behavioural Profile, care moment detection (birthdays, life events, service risks), and personalised gift/meeting recommendations.
- **Live Supabase Backend**: Real authentication, real-time data, row-level security, and Edge Functions — not just a static frontend demo.

## AI Tool Attribution

This prototype was developed with AI-assisted coding support. AI tools were used to expand seeded data, structure the demo workflow, write deterministic engine logic, improve the interface, and create competition documentation.

The runtime application uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for three specific features: Smart Learning Path recommendations, Knowledge Gap Detection, and Client Suggestion generation. All other recommendations are generated from local deterministic rule-based engines.

## 💡 Judge Feedback & Iterative Roadmap

Following our presentation, we received highly constructive feedback from the judging panel. We actively use this feedback to drive the next iteration of our architecture.

> **Judge's Comment:** *"Allows consent ability. The prioritising of clients can be tricky as there may be missing elements of relationship or mannerism of the client. Good idea. Excellent and smooth presentation."*

### Our Engineering Response to the "Mannerism" Challenge
The judge correctly identified a major flaw in traditional CRM scoring: it ignores human nuance. If an AI only prioritizes clients based on premium due dates or portfolio size, it destroys the advisor-client relationship.

To directly solve this, our next iteration introduces the **Active Empathy Pipeline & Behavioral Matrix**:
1. **Capturing Mannerisms:** Instead of rigid data fields, our web-speech ingestion tool captures raw, unstructured conversational notes. The AI extracts specific "soft signals" (e.g., family protective instincts, analytical tendencies, or recent emotional life events).
2. **Behavioral Prioritization:** The priority scoring engine does not just look at revenue. It injects a massive priority boost for **Empathy Triggers** (e.g., a client mentioning a minor accident or a child going to college). 
3. **The Action Composer:** The system categorizes the client's mannerisms into Archetypes (e.g., "Relational Guardian" vs. "Analytical Mind") to ensure the generated next-best action matches the client's exact psychological communication style. 

By digitizing "soft skills," the system ensures the human element remains the primary driver of client prioritization.
